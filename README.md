# Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, and Spark Tips

Welcome to the Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, and Spark Tips repository! This repository is designed to provide practical examples and insightful tips for using Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg within Apache Spark environments. Here, you'll find various Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate different aspects of managing and manipulating big data with these powerful tools.

## Repository Contents

- **Delta_Lake_SCD_Tips.ipynb**
  - Demonstrates handling Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) using Delta Lake, covering various SCD types and their implementations.

- **Delta_Lake_Tips_SCD7.ipynb**
  - Focuses on a hybrid SCD type 7 approach which combines features of Type 1 (overwrite) and Type 2 (historical tracking) within Delta Lake.

- **apache_iceberg.ipynb**
  - Provides examples on how to configure and use Apache Iceberg, a table format for large analytic datasets, within a Spark environment.

- **delta_iceberg_integration.ipynb**
  - Showcases the integration of Delta Lake and Apache Iceberg, demonstrating how to leverage the strengths of both in a unified data management strategy.
